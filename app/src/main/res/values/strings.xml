        <item>You just finished reading this amazing book called Coders, and you think that adding it to the syllabus will help students gain insight into the tech world, even if it is a little more work for them. What do you do?</item>
        <item>The administration tells you that counting attendance by following along to lecture slides isn’t a good method, since students can simply follow along for their friends given their netID and password. It wants you to use i-clickers for attendance. What do you do?</item>
        <item>MP0 is out and it\'s so hard the students need therapy! You’re not professionally trained for that, but you can help them in other ways. What do you do?</item>
        <item>You see a lot of posts on the forum and on Reddit from beginner coders claiming that CS 125 is too hard, and that it isn’t beginner-friendly. What do you do?</item>
        <item>MP1 is out, and cheating levels have increased drastically. What do you do?</item>
        <item>There’s an epidemic! Well, not really, but it’s flu season and just about three fourths of the students are coughing in lecture. What do you do?</item>
        <item>MP2 is out, and it’s harder than ever! Your students are stressed out, and your TAs and CAs are beginning to agree that it’s too hard, too. What do you do?</item>
        <item>The mid-term grades are supposed to be uploaded on self-service, but the autograder is down! What do you do?</item>
        <item>You notice that the class average is far lower than those of the previous years’, and you want to try to fix it. What do you do?</item>
        <item>You noticed a fairly offensive image on the forum with your face photoshopped onto another image—let’s not go into detail. What do you do?</item>
        <item>Your underpaid and overworked TAs and CAs are done. They go on strike against CS 125 until more are hired. What do you do?</item>
        <item>Your students have reported bugs in online grading. What do you do?</item>
        <item>Due to heavy scheduling, the administration keeps trying to postpone the CS 125 fair. They tell you now that the Fall 2019 fair must be held about a week before Spring break! What do you do?</item>
        <item>It’s the end of the semester and your students are getting bored. Most of them spend lectures watching Netflix. What do you do?</item>
        <item>Your students are losing interest in lectures, and you want to keep their attention. You’re thinking about how to fix this when your cat, Xyz, jumps onto your laptop. What do you do?</item>

    <string name="desc_main">Welcome, Geoff! You’re back for the Fall 2019 semester to teach CS 125.
       Your students last Spring were moderately happy with your work, congrats!
       However, that means that your new batch of students and the university have high expectations from you
       to do a great job, yet again. \n\nLet\'s get started! Choose the number of weeks in the semester: </string>
    <string name="help_intro">  This is your handy help page, informing you of the various tools that’ll
       aid you in teaching your class. Tap a subheading to get more info on it.</string>
    <string name="help_home_title">\nHome</string>
    <string name="help_home_body">
    \nThe semester is divided into 5/10/15 weeks depending on what you chose. You’ll be able to go to the next week only after planning the difficulties for homework, quiz (if any), midterm (if any), and MP checkpoint (if any). Check the forum and university email every week for helpful tips!

    \n\nYou have two satisfaction bars: student satisfaction, and university satisfaction (including administration, you, and anybody who is paid to run CS 125). Your actions in the game will affect these bars. If, at any point, either of the bars hit zero, you automatically lose the game.

    \n\nEvery week, you’ll face a random encounter, and your actions will affect student and university satisfaction. Choose wisely.

    \n\nYou have three bonuses:
    \nChuchu the dog/Xyz the cat (either one): boosts student satisfaction
    \nThe real Geoff Challen: boosts university satisfaction
    \nJava Chad Ben Nordick: boosts both student and university satisfaction by a little bit
    \nYou can use each bonus only once per game.

</string>
    <string name="help_forum_title">\nForum</string>
    <string name="help_forum_body">This is where you’ll learn what your students feel about the course so far. It can be helpful to know where you’re going wrong, or what you’re doing correctly.
</string>
    <string name="help_mail_title">\nUniversity Mail</string>
    <string name="help_mail_body">This is where you’ll periodically get email from the university, letting you know if they’re happy with what you’ve been doing. This, too, can be useful in pinpointing your errors to help you make the next week better.
</string>
    <string name="help_hqmm_title">\nHomework, Quizzes, Midterms, MP</string>
    <string name="help_hqmm_body">Here, you’ll set the difficulty of each aspect of the course for the following
        week, from 0 to 9 (0 is the easiest, 9 is the hardest). There’ll also be advice that should help you decide
        the difficulty. A few things to note:
        \n1. \tMidterms are available in weeks 4, 9, and 14. \n   Quizzes are not available during these weeks.
        \n2. \tMPs start from week 2, and won’t be available in week \t   14.</string>
